/*
 * $ cmd seed msg_print_cnt "msg_string" line_limit
 *
 * likely bug when written: It may go over the line limit depending on what i
 * do in the loop. Its not worth it making it exact i dont think but if its not
 * really lame ill make it happen. But before writing im not garunteeing the
 * line prints will be exect.
 *
 * obv theres no error checking or anything unless i just tangent another hard
 * tangent into the rest of the abyss.
 *
 *
 * goood nuff, it lines up when using 20 as the line limit. It ends as 22
 * because of the two lines i print at the end with final line count and shit.
 *
 * So theres work to do if i ever want to make it exact on the line limit.
 *
 *
 * would be interesting to do a program that makes blank files of any
 * particular size like the files used at that one place. Apparently theres
 * a win cli prog to do it? But also that means prolly already a linux one.
 * look into it, then write one? :D
