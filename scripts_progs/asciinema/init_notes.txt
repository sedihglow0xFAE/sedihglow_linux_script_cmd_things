-------- init notes from list on ascii stuffs ---
- asciinema setup script
  - make sure you know how to use it.
    - asciinema rec -c "asciinema play -s 5 -i 2 initial.cast" -t "My fancy title" final.cast
    -
	 Available options:
	      -i, --idle-time-limit=<sec>
		     Limit  replayed  terminal inactivity to max <sec> seconds (can be frac‐
		     tional)

	      -s, --speed=<factor>
		     Playback speed (can be fractional)

 While playing the following keyboard shortcuts are available:

	      Space  Toggle pause

	      .	     Step through a recording a frame at a time (when paused)

	      Ctrl+C Exit

       Recommendation: run `asciinema play' in a terminal of dimensions not smaller than the
       one  used  for recording as there’s no “transcoding” of control sequences for the new
       terminal size.
