Wrapper around gcc (or w/e) that prints stuff, no one knows your compiling, it
even says its compiling. It says its compiling because it lets someone know your
compiling so they dont control C until you catch the exception and control C
doesnt stop compilation but brings you to another printout loop that says not
compiling, then they think they stopped your compilation, then it starts
printing again after awhile to let you know, maybe it was compiling, maybe it
got stopped, maybe it started after it got stopped, who knows what the wrapper
around gcc does and how many function layers (abstraction) there are doing
nonsense while compiling for a background of smiles.
